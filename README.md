# LINQ Practice Solutions

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) practice problems and solutions in C#. The examples cover various LINQ operators and techniques, including:

## **Contents:**

- **Restriction Operators:** Filtering elements using `Where`.
- **Transformation Operators:** Using `Select`, `SelectMany`, and anonymous types.
- **Aggregate Operators:** Summation, averaging, and grouping.
- **Sorting Operators:** Sorting with `OrderBy`, `ThenBy`, and custom comparers.
- **Partitioning Operators:** Using `Take`, `Skip`, `TakeWhile`, and `SkipWhile`.
- **Set Operators:** Using `Distinct`, `Union`, `Intersect`, and `Except`.
- **Grouping:** Grouping elements using `GroupBy` with both built-in and custom comparers.
- **Element Operators:** Accessing elements using `First`, `Last`, `Single`, and their variants.
- **Quantifiers:** Checking conditions using `Any`, `All`, and `Contains`.
- **Generation Operators:** Generating sequences using `Range` and `Repeat`.
- **Join Operators:** Performing inner joins, group joins, and cross joins.
- **Miscellaneous:** Combining LINQ with file input and output using `dictionary_english.txt`.

## **How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdo7amdy/LINQ.git
   ```

2. Open the solution file in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

3. Ensure that `dictionary_english.txt` is located in the root directory of your project.

4. Build and run the solution to see the output of each example.

## **Project Structure:**

- **Program.cs:** Contains the main LINQ examples and solutions.
- **ListGenerators.cs:** Provides methods to generate sample lists of products, customers, and numbers.
- **dictionary_english.txt:** Used as an input file for certain string-based exercises.
